# Python-Quiz-TWT
This is a 5-question quiz about Python-related topics, written in Python. I created this project while following along with Tech With Tim's YouTube video titled "5 Mini Python Projects - For Beginners". This project was the first of the five projects in the video, specifically from time stamp 4:51 - 25:01.
